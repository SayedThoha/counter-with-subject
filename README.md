# Angular Counter App using BehaviorSubject

## ðŸ“– Description

This is a simple Angular application that demonstrates how to create a **reactive counter** using a shared service and RxJS `BehaviorSubject`. The counter value can be **incremented**, **decremented**, or **reset**, and the updated value is automatically reflected across all components that subscribe to it.
